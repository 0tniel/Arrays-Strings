# Arrays-Strings
<br>
<p align='center'><b> Experiment 7A </b></p>

## Aim

To demonstrate how to initialize an array and display its elements in C++.

## Software Used
- Dev C++

## Theory
<p>Arrays in C++ are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. An array is a collection of variables that are accessed with an index number.</p>

### Array Initialization

<p>An array can be initialized with predefined values at the time of declaration. The elements in the array are stored in contiguous memory locations, and each element can be accessed using an index.</p>

### Syntax 

```cpp
data_type array_name[array_size];
```
### Array Traversal

<p>Traversing an array involves accessing each element of the array sequentially. This can be done using loops such as for or while loops.</p>

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start.
<br>
Step 2: Declare and initialize an array arr with 5 elements: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
<br>
Step 3: Use a loop to traverse the array from the first element to the last.
<br>
Step 4: Print each element of the array.
<br>
Step 5: End.
<br>

## Output

## Conclusion

This program successfully demonstrates the initialization and traversal of an array in C++. The elements of the array are displayed sequentially as expected.

<p align='center'><b> Experiment 7B </b></p>

## Aim

To input elements into an array and display them.

## Software Used
- Dev C++

## Theory

<p>Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. This program demonstrates how to input values into an array from the user and then display these values. The array elements are accessed sequentially using a loop.</p>

### Array Input and Output

1. <b>Input</b>: The user is prompted to enter values for each element of the array.
<br>
2. <b>Output</b>: The program displays each element of the array in the order they were inputted.

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start.
<br>
Step 2: Declare an integer variable size and read the size of the array from the user.
<br>
Step 3: Declare an array arr of size size.
<br>
Step 4: Use a loop to read size number of elements into the array.
<br>
Step 5: Use another loop to display the elements of the array.
<br>
Step 6: End.
<br>

## Conclusion

<p>The program effectively demonstrates how to input a specified number of elements into an array and display those elements. It illustrates the basic usage of loops for both input and output operations in C++.</p>

## Aim

To find and display the maximum and minimum values in an array of integers.

## Software Used
- Dev C++

## Theory

An array in C++ is a collection of variables of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. To find the maximum and minimum values in an array, we need to traverse the array while keeping track of the largest and smallest values encountered.

### Array Traversal

To determine the maximum and minimum values, iterate through each element of the array and compare each element with the current maximum and minimum values. Update the maximum or minimum as needed.

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start.
<br>
Step 2: Declare an integer variable size and read the size of the array from the user.
<br>
Step 3: Declare an array arr of size size.
<br>
Step 4: Read size number of elements into the array.
<br>
Step 5: Initialize max and min with the first element of the array.
<br>
Step 6: Traverse the array and update max and min based on comparisons.
<br>
Step 7: Display the maximum and minimum values.
<br>
Step 8: End.
<br>

## Output

## Conclusion

The program successfully identifies and displays the maximum and minimum values in an array by traversing the array and comparing each element. This approach efficiently finds the desired values.

# String

<br>
<p align='center'><b> Experiment 7F </b></p>

## Aim

To write a C++ program that displays a string.

## Software Used
- Dev C++

## Theory
<p>In C++, a string can be represented as a character array or by using the std::string class. In this experiment, a character array is used to store and display the string. The cout statement is used to output the string to the console.</p>

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start.
<br>
Step 2: Declare and initialize a character array with the string "Otniel".
<br>
Step 3: Use the cout statement to display the string.
<br>
Step 4: End.
<br>

## Output

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e629cbc-f8d9-4e9b-8076-b4ac29a5967d)

## Conclusion

The program successfully displays the string "Otniel" on the screen. This simple program demonstrates how to use character arrays in C++ to store and display text.
